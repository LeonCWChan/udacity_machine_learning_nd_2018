# Investment and Trading Capstone Project
-Build a Stock Price Indicator using Machine Learning techniques- 

This project explores the problem of stock price prediction using supervised learning model and a recurrent neural network. Essential, to predict the adjusted close price of the day immediately after the end of the given training end date, of a given stock as accurate as possible using historical stock prices. 

## Getting Started

The code and plotting process are done in an iPython Notebook. So to run the notebook you will need a platform which can run the notebook file. 

1. Option 1 - Kaggle
I have been using Kaggle to run my notebook file during the project development. It is an online and free platform for me to run my notebook file. You have to first open a free account in kaggle. Then after you logged in, select the 'Kernels' tab on the top bar of the website. Then around the top right side of the page click 'New Kernel'. Then select 'NoteBook' on the right option. Then on the top bar, next to 'Python', click the icon looking like a cloud with up arrow on it. Then you can upload my project notebook and run it on the platform.

2. Option 2 - ipython jupyter
It is also possible to run my project notebook file using ipython jupyter. The instructions are listed below in the prerequesties.

### Prerequisites
Python is a requirement Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7. But I wrote the project in Python 3.* environment so I recommended it more. Also to have easy installation for the ipython jypyter you need to get the 'Anaconda Distribution'.

### Installing

Installing python 3.*

```
//for windows
Visit the link and download the installer for Python 3.*:
https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
```

```
//for macs
Visit the link and download the installer for Python 3.*:
https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/
or
run on terminal each line:
xcode-select --install
then
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
then
brew install python3
```

Installing Jupyter Notebook

```
//for windows and windows
Visit the link and download the installer for anaconda:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

After downloaded the installer, execute it to install the software.

If the installation is done, you can run the Jupyter Notebook by running the following command at the Terminal (Mac and Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):
jupyter notebook
```
